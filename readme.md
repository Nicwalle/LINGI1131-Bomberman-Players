## How to use ?
Clone/Download the **content** of the repository into your project.

**Warning !** The players must be in the same directory as your other compiled files (``Input.ozf``, ``PlayerManager.ozf``...). Don't place the players in a subdirectory.

The ``.gitignore`` file of this project has been thought such that it ignores every file which does not follow the following pattern: ``Player[0-9]*.ozf`` (Player followed by at least one digit followed by anything .ozf). It won't affect your project.

## How to contribute ?
1. Compile your **working** player into a file having the following name:
   ``Player[GROUP NUMBER][PLAYER NAME].ozf`` (e.g. Player003Mike.ozf).
   [PLAYER NAME] identifies your different players.
2. Add your player and a description of its behavior in the Players' description table of the ``readme``.
3. Make a pull request.
